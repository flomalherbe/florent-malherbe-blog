| GENERAL TOPIC       | creation of amino acids and life with electric spark                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| PROCEDURE           | The writer explain the theory and the experiment of electric spark. He explains first that in the ancient atmosphere the common molecules were hydrogen, methane, and ammonia, so that atmosphere's molecules was zapped and with interractions in water amino acids appeared. The article also says that the spark provided the energy for the molecules to recombine into amino acids. The volcanic clouds are composed of the same molecules of the atmosphere so when there is lightning in volcanic clouds there can be amino acids. Amino acids combine to make proteins.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| CONCLUSIONS         | In this theory there were no life without spark. Amino acids are importants molecules in the apparition of life. Volcans can be life's precursors                                                                                                                                                                    |
| REMAINING QUESTIONS | How can be sure that's the right theory of the origin of life? we will explore more theories in the others article                                                                                                                                                                                |
