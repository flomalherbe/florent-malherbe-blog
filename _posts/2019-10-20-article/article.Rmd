| PROCEDURE           | Scientists and especially Louis Pasteur made some experiences to proove that the life doesn't appear spontaneously. That's a step in the research in the origin of life. Louis Pasteur demonstrated that the air had no "reproductive power". |
| CONCLUSIONS         | Life can't appear with simple molecules and can't be create just in the air                                                                                                                                                                   |
