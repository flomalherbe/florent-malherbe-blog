| PUBLISHED IN        | Sciencenorway                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| GENERAL TOPIC       | The moon consequences for the life on earth                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| PROCEDURE           | The moon influences some earth mechanisms and influence the climate. For example the moon has relations with the tides and forward the biological life of seas. Moon stabalises also the earth and forces our planet to stay in his orbit around the sun. The scientist in this article says that we could survive without the moon but the life would be very different. The article also says that the moon is leaving the earth four centimeters by years.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| CONCLUSIONS         | Without the moon the appiration of life would be different because the general conditions of life would be different (climate, the earth's orbit around the sun,...)                                                                                                                                                                    |
| REMAINING QUESTIONS | How the rotation of the earth around the sun will react at the lost of the moon? Would the orbit of the earth will be infintly stable?                                                                                                                                                                                 |
